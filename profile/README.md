## üöÄ Overview

**Planner Studio** is a macOS productivity app designed for structured planning, time management, and goal tracking. Unlike traditional calendars, it provides a comprehensive environment where you can schedule events, manage tasks, and track long-term projects in one place.  

With Planner Studio, you can break down goals into actionable steps, organize them into timelines, and monitor your progress through intuitive visual charts. It goes beyond simple reminders ‚Äî the app creates a workspace for balancing daily routines with strategic goals. Users can assign deadlines, set recurring tasks, and attach notes or documents directly to each event, ensuring that nothing gets lost in scattered tools.  

Whether you‚Äôre a freelancer managing projects, a student organizing study plans, or a professional structuring work-life balance, Planner Studio adapts to your workflow. The app‚Äôs macOS-native interface makes planning fluid, while export and sync options ensure you can integrate it into broader productivity ecosystems.
